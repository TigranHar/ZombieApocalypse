How to use: Firstly download the plugin. Then move it to your plugins folder and start the server.

<b>Commands</b>
<ul>
<li><b>start-zombieApocalypse</b> - starts a grace period of 1 hour after which zombies will start falling from the sky (literally).</li>
<li><b>stop-zombieApocalypse</b> - stops zombies from spawning, and adds one to your night's survived score.</li>
<li><b>reload-zombieApocalypse</b> - reloads the plugin with all the values (nights survived, countdown, etc.).</li>
</ul>

<b>Main Goal</b>: The main goal is to survive as many nights as you can.

<b>Zombie AI</b>: The zombies will be able to see you from 100s of blocks away once its nighttime. If you pillar up a bit too high they will start jumping and hitting you. The zombies will be deleted if there are too many of them in a certain area.

<b>Zombie types</b>: Right now there are 4 types of zombies -
<ul>
<li><b>Normal zombie </b>- speed 3</li>
<li><b>Hulk</b> - speed 3, strength 3</li>
<li><b>Tank</b> - speed 3, full diamond armour set, diamond axe</li>
<li><b>Bomber</b> - speed 3, ability to spawn TNT on you if its close enough.</li>
</ul>

The hardest of all to kill is the Tank, but its fairly easy to run away from it.<br>
The most dangerous zombie is the bomber, it can spawn TNT on you even if you are 30 blocks above him. You will know which one is he once you see him.

A config file with all the values (potion effect amplifier, zombie limit per area, etc.) will be added in another version.
